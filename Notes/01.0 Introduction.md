# Lecture 01.0: Introduction

## SDLC

Verficiation and testing is added to each stage of the Waterfall Model to improve system reliability
Rigorous testing must be completed before moving onto the next step
Testing is critical in any SDLC implementation

## Continuous Delivery

Similar to and frequently discussed with Agile Methods
Iterative but software is kept in a state where it is always ready for deployment
Does not have a seperate event of "software deployment" to prepare for release
Automation plays a key role in testing and development
