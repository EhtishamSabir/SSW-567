# Homework 02 Experience

## 1. Challenges

The only (minor) challenge I experienced during this assignment was the re-learning of Python's syntax after 3 years of exlusively working in Java.

## 2. Requirements

I thought the requirements specification for this assignment were sufficient and easy to understand.

## 3. Tool Challenges

I didnt encounter any challenges with the tools. I included the tests in a separate file to better organize the code, but that was a result of personal preference.

## 4. Testing Criteria

Since it has been many years since I studied Geometry, I spent some time re-learning the rules of triangles. This helped me remember some of their attributes, most notably the fact that **both** scalene and isosceles triangles can be right. To ensure the sufficiency of my test program, I wrote a test for every type of triangle, tests for both kinds of right triangles (isosceles and scalene), and a test for an invalid triangle. These were all the possible cases that I was able to think of.
